```{r setup, include=FALSE}
## Link RStudio to Zotero (step 6) : https://gsverhoeven.github.io/post/zotero-rmarkdown-csl/
# remotes::install_github("paleolimbot/rbbt") # install it once for citation

## clear workspace
rm(list=ls())

## Seed for random number generation
set.seed(42)

## Load packages
# install.packages("pacman")
library(pacman)
# pacman::p_load(
#   # insert packages' name here
# )

## Set working directory to current folder
# setwd(dirname(rstudioapi::getSourceEditorContext()$path)) # this needs to be commented for 'render_script_mac.command' to work

## Load environment or read .csv files
# load("mydata.RData")
# df <- read.csv("assets/data/mydata.csv")

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
